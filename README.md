# MendelianVariants
Package for finding Mendelian disease, related genes, and potentially pathogenic gene variants

## Installation Instructions

First, you will need to install a few Bioconductor dependencies for scoring variants. These take a little while to install. 

```R
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("fitCons.UCSC.hg19")
biocLite("phastCons100way.UCSC.hg19")
biocLite("GenomicScores")
```
If you don't already have devtools installed:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Now you are ready to install this package!

```R

```
